      <td colspan="2">&nbsp;The Czech Republic is a Central European country with a political system based on democracy and the rule of law. Its form of government is that of a democratic republic, meaning that political power resides in the citizens, who actively participate through free, regular, and pluralistic elections. In these elections, citizens choose their political representatives, ensuring that the government reflects the popular will. Furthermore, there are several political parties representing diverse ideas and positions, fostering debate and political participation.</td>

      <td colspan="2">The Czech Republic has a parliamentary political system, making Parliament the most important state body. Parliament is divided into two chambers: the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. The Prime Minister is the head of government and is responsible for directing the country's domestic and foreign policy, always with the support of Parliament. The President of the Republic acts as head of state and primarily serves a representative function, although they also have certain powers, such as appointing the Prime Minister and signing laws. This system ensures a balance of power and constant parliamentary oversight of the government.&nbsp;</td>

    <tr>
      <td colspan="2">Another fundamental aspect of Czech politics is respect for the rule of law and fundamental rights. The Constitution establishes that all persons are equal before the law and that no authority is above it. The country guarantees rights such as freedom of expression, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, and the right to participate in political life. Furthermore, it has an independent judiciary and a Constitutional Court responsible for protecting the Constitution and ensuring that laws and government decisions do not violate citizens' rights. Thanks to these principles, the Czech Republic maintains a stable, democratic political system based on respect for freedoms.&nbsp;</td>
